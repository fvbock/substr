Give me a place to stand," said Archimedes, "and I will move the
world." These men moved the world, and so can we all. Few will have
the greatness to bend history itself, but each of us can work to
change a small portion of events, and in the total of all those acts
will be written the history of this generation. Thousands of Peace
Corps volunteers are making a difference in isolated villages and city
slums in dozens of countries. Thousands of unknown men and women in
Europe resisted the occupation of the Nazis and many died, but all
added to the ultimate strength and freedom of their countries. It is
from numberless diverse acts of courage and belief that human history
is shaped. Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve
the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a
tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different
centers of energy and daring those ripples build a current which can
sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.
